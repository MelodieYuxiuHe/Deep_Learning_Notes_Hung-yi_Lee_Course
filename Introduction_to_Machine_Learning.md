What's AI?

Hand-crafted rules are not called AI.

ML: Looking for a (complex) function from data. 



3 Steps:

1) Have a set of functions

2) Evaluate these functions

3) Choose the best function



4 Scenarios:

- Semi-supervised Learning:

​       Examples:

​       You have both labelled and unlabelled data, the unlabelled data can be helpful

- Transfer Learning:

​       Examples:

​       You have some labelled but irrelevant data (e.g. you want to predict cat/dog, but you have Haruhi Suzumiya’s labelled images)

- Unsupervised Learning:

​       Examples:

​       'Create' animals after seeing images of animals

- Reinforcement Learning: 

  Supervised learning give 'correct' answer, Reinforcement leraning gives a score, no answer, machine have to figure out how to perform better itself. 

​       Example:

​       Alpha Go

- Supervised Learning: Regression/Classification (Binary/Multi-class)

​       Examples:

​       Playing GO: classification of a 19*19 classes, training data

​       Structured learning: (beyong classification)

​       e.g. translation system (Relativeness?)
